    <p>A cyborg (/ˈsaɪbɔːrɡ/) (also known as cybernetic organism, cyber-organism, cyber-organic being, cybernetically enhanced organism, cybernetically augmented organism, technorganic being, techno-organic being, or techno-organism)—a portmanteau of cybernetic and organism—is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts. The term was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.[1] In contrast to biorobots and androids, the term cyborg applies to a living organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on feedback.[2] "Cyborg" is not the same thing as bionics, biorobotics, or androids; it applies to an organism that has restored function or, especially, enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback, for example: prostheses, artificial organs, implants or, in some cases, wearable technology.[3] Cyborg technologies may enable or support collective intelligence.[4] A related, possibly broader, term is the "augmented human".[3][5][6] While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, including humans, they might conceivably be any organism.</p>
